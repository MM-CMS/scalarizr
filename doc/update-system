commons:
  user-data
  queryenv


1. --- copy-paste code 			
2. -+ separate repo and git submodules

3. --+++ join codebase into single project


good:
	we DRY and share queryenv, rpc and userdata libs

bad:
	we still need rpc and security for upd-server (s: place rpc to separate repo and link)


distribution

how to distribute single codebase as 2 separate packages?
	basically separate setup.py files
	commons should come in scalr-upd-client and scalarizr will use them

how to distribute this single codebase as omnibus package?
	A: embed should contains all python deps, all binary deps (including python), scalr-upd-client 
		bad: 
			not easy to update dependencies, we made a focus on a solution to update scalarizr not scalr-upd-client


	B: two separate embeds with it's own binaries and pyps
		good:
			we got what we want: a two separate packages, with no cross deps
		bad:
			big packages

distribute as a single package

	distribution as a single package simplier to maintain and structucally understand
